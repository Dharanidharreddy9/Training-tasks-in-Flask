In this API I have used Postgres as a database with SQLAlchemy ORM in app.py file.
Marshmallow to create schema and token to authorize user in main.py file.


I am entered all the packages whatever used in this API.
After that I have given a connection between python and database.


I have created a table with the name of User, and in this table I am given some attributes like id, name ,email etc...(24L-29L)


Application working procedure:(postman)

1)First user will be signed in with their own credentials in the form like name, email and the password. This is signing in to API.
2)After signin user will login with the email and the password so that user will get the token. ex ("token:ldsvcscbsCHSBCwdciwbcibwdhhwjb")
3)If the user wants to get the data, then using the token key he will get the JSON data.
  we are using the symmetric algorithm to decode the token into JSON data.
  For that data we need to enter x-access-token and the token key in headers, if user hit on send then they will get the JSON Data.
