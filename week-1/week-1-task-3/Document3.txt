Implemented DDL, DQL, DML, DCL, TCL, SQL Joins types in a single file.

I am using only one package that psycopg2.
I have connected the database using psycopg2.

working procedure:
1)If we are running this code it is showing that select one topic, so that user will be elected one topic.
2)If the user will select option 1 i.e. DDL topic then user will entered into the while loop and he gets the options like CREATE,DROP,ALTER,TRUNCATE.
3)So depend on the user requirement he will select one option then user will get the data accordingly.
4)After completing the each and every topic the connection will be committed so that the data will be updated in the database.
5)In the same manner all the other topics also worked accordingly.
6) If the user wants to enter their own query then he will select option 5 so that user can enter the query and he will get the data whatever he wants.
7)Finally their is option 6, if the user wants to quit from this loop then if he hits on 6 option the connection will be closed.so that user will be exited from the database.


simple procedure:
1.DDL, 2.DML,3.DCL,4.joins, 5.Direct Query from the Database, 6.Exit
Select anyone Topic: #If user select any one topic then it will be enter into that topic
                     #If user select 1

1.CREATE, 2.Drop, 3.Alter ,4.Truncate
select anyone option: #If the user wants to drop table or ALTER data in the TABLE
                      # If user select 1

Output: "Table created successfully"
        # The table is created

1.DDL, 2.DML,3.DCL,4.joins, 5.Direct Query from the Database, 6.Exit
Select anyone Topic: #if the user select 4

1.Inner Join, 2.Left Join, 3.Right Join, 4.Full Join
 select any one option: #if user wants to get common data then he will go with INNER join.

output:[(1, 'keyboard', 400, 4, 4, 'John', 'Reinharbit', 25, 'UK'),
        (2, 'Mouse', 300, 4, 4, 'John', 'Reinharbit', 25, 'UK'),
        (3, 'Monitor', 12000, 3, 3, 'Davis', 'Robinson', 22, 'UK'),
        (4, 'keyboard', 400, 1, 1, 'John', 'Doe', 31, 'USA'),
        (5, 'Mousepad', 250, 2, 2, 'Robert', 'Luna', 22, 'USA')]

1.DDL, 2.DML,3.DCL,4.joins, 5.Direct Query from the Database, 6.Exit
Select anyone Topic: #if the user select 5(here user can give the query directly according to their requirement)
                     # select * from customers;

output:[(1, 'John', 'Doe', 31, 'USA'),
        (2, 'Robert', 'Luna', 22, 'USA'),
        (3, 'Davis', 'Robinson', 22, 'UK'),
        (4, 'John', 'Reinharbit', 25, 'UK'),
        (5, 'Betty', 'Doe', 28, 'UAE')]
