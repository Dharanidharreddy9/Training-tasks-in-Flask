           FLASK API'S(ALL CRUD OPERATIONS)

I have implemented all the CRUD operations using flask API's

I am using 3 packages in flask(Flask, jsonify and request)

GET:
 GET method fetching all the data from the JSON file.
Description: Given a route using @app.route inside of that I have given home URL to fetch all the data.

GET:
 We get a single record also from the file using id
Description: Given a route using @app.route inside of that I have given URL and in URL I have passed a function and it will check the id so that we can get the single record from the file.
             I am defining the data in that I have given 1 object to store the data after that I have passed a for loop and in this loop there is a condition it will check the id whatever the user given and it is print that id.

POST:
POST method is inserting the data whatever we are posting.
Description: In post method I have check the data is I the form of JSON or not and there is title or not if the these 2 or not then it will shown error.
            Get the data from the user and it will print from the output side.
            After that it will check the id is there or not if the id is already there then it will print as duplicated id.
            If the id not already there then the new data will be appended to the previous file.
            Status: Added successfully

PUT:
PUT method is modifying the data.


Delete:
Delete method is Delete a single record or whole data from the file.
Description: we can delete a single record using id.
             In if condition I am checking id and it will delete the record.
             I am using the remove method() to delete the record.


setting debug to True enables hot reload
and also provides a debugger shell
if you hit an error while running the server
