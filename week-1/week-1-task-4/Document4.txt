In this module I have implemented all the CRUD Operations using psycopg2

First I have connected with the database using psycopg2

Working procedure:
 1.Insert, 2.Read, 3.Update, 4.Delete, 5. Exit
 Enter any one option: # if the user wants to Get the data then he will select 2

Output:   publisher_Id =  1
          publisher_name =  Packt
          publisher_estd  =  1950
          publisher_location  =  chennai
          publisher_type  =  books

          publisher_Id =  2
          publisher_name =  Springer
          publisher_estd  =  1950
          publisher_location  =  chennai
          publisher_type  =  books

          etc...


1.Insert, 2.Read, 3.Update, 4.Delete, 5. Exit
Enter any one option: # If the user wants to Update he data then he will select 3

Output: user will give the id wherever he wants to change the data.
        accordingly it will be changed.


1.Insert, 2.Read, 3.Update, 4.Delete, 5. Exit
Enter any one option: # If the user wants to exit from this loop then he will select 5

Output: "PostgreSQL connection is closed"
        "you are exited form the database"
